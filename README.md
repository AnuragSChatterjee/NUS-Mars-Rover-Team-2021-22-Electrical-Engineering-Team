Worked as an Electrical Engineer for the NUS Mars Rover Team 2021/22: A flagship robotics competition and engineering team where we represent the National University Of Singapore in creating a martian rover to be sent to the US for competition, and we compete with 50+ universities worldwide.

I helped out create the schematics on CircuitLab and power calculations for all electronic components for each rover subsystem and attached our works above with my teammate.
